                        I graduated last year from Tennessee Tech University with a bachelors in Computer Science. For the past four months I interned with Achieve Internet. I was to be hired on full time but due to the pandemic they had to reduce their workforce. Since then I have been working on personal projects and am actively searching for a full time web development position. Below are some of my most recent projects.
